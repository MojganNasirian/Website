# Website
The website must contain:  - A Header with Title - A Sidebar with a collapsible menu - A Main page with Title in the middle. Title both in the header and Main should reflect which menu category you have clicked on.
This data should be presented in a sidebar, as a menu and that you can then collapse the menu
(so that you do not see sub-items if you have clicked on a parent). It must be clear which sub-item you have marked.

How To run the app:
Install create-react-app globally 
**npm install -g create-react-app
**
Create a new React app:
**npx create-react-app my-website
**
Replace the content of src/App.js with the code from MyWebsite.tsx.

Navigate to your project directory:
**cd my-website
**
Start the development server:
**npm start
**
This will start your React app, and you can view it in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
